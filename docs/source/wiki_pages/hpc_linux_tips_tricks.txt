===== HPC/Linux Tips & Tricks =====
This page compiles various routine tasks useful for working with the simulations in HPC environments, that are small enough to be explained in a 1-2 paragraphs.
==== Transferring files without having to stay logged in ==== 
When moving around large datasets it is useful to keep the transfer going even if you want to log out. To do so, start running your usual transfer command:

<code bash>
scp -r username@my.hpc.cluster.edu:source_path destination_path
</code>

or

<code bash>
rsync -av -e ssh username@my.hpc.cluster.edu:source_path destination_path
</code>
\\

While the transfer is running, stop it with ''CTRL+Z''. Then, restart it in the background with ''bg''. Finally, to keep the process running after you log off, run ''disown -h''.
