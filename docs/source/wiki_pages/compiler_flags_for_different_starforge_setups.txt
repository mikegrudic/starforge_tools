Here we provide some example ''%%Config.sh%%'' files for different types of STARFORGE physics setups. 
==== Notes on OPENMP and MULTIPLEDOMAINS flags ==== 
Note that all setups may optionally include the ''%%OPENMP%%'' and ''%%MULTIPLEDOMAINS%%'' flags for performance tuning - you will need to experiment to determine the optimal settings for your setup and machine - see the [[http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~phopkins/Site/GIZMO_files/gizmo_documentation.html|GIZMO documentation]] for details on what these do. For medium sized (~2e7 gas cells) runs on Frontera or Stampede-2, ''%%OPENMP=2%%'' and leaving out ''%%MULTIPLEDOMAINS%%'' (which defaults to 8) work well as a starting point.

==== "Standard" STARFORGE "Full Physics" Setup ====
This is the setup used in most STARFORGE runs, including all important feedback mechanisms and using explicit radiative transfer in 5 bands - e.g. [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00882|as in this paper]].

==== Isothermal MHD Setup ====
This is the simplest setup that will form stars and produce well-converged (but incorrect!) answers for the mass moments of the IMF (see [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01421v1|this paper]]).
