====== STARFORGE Wiki ======

{{:anvil_of_creation.png?200}}

Welcome to our project wiki! This is intended to serve as a repository of useful knowledge for developing, running, and analyzing the [[http://www.starforge.space|STARFORGE]] simulations, and related simulations using the [[http://http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~phopkins/Site/GIZMO.html|GIZMO]] code.

==== Contributing to this wiki ====

If you have spent time figuring out a technical task when working with the simulations, chances are somebody else has too, and it's a good idea to write it down to help out the next person. This wiki is set up so that approved users can create and edit pages. If you wish to contribute, please register an account, and you'll be able to edit the wiki once approved by the admin.
