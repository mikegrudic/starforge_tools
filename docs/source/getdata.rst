Data Access On Rusty
********************

A spreadsheet documenting existing simulations is available `here <https://starforge.space/spreadsheet.html>`. The STARFORGE dataset is mounted on disk on the Flatiron Institute's cluster Rusty. The preferred way to access it is via the `STARFORGE@CCA Globus collection <https://app.globus.org/file-manager/collections/ffefc2be-a4cf-47c5-9e62-7b7186a86958>`_, which can be freely accessed through any Globus account.

You can also browse the dataset directly `here <https://users.flatironinstitute.org/~mgrudic/starforge_data>`.
