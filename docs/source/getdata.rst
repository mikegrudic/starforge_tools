Data Access On Rusty
********************


A spreadsheet documenting existing simulations is available `here <https://starforge.space/spreadsheet.html>`_. The STARFORGE dataset is mounted on disk on the Flatiron Institute's cluster Rusty. The preferred way to access it is via the `STARFORGE@CCA Globus collection <https://app.globus.org/file-manager/collections/ffefc2be-a4cf-47c5-9e62-7b7186a86958>`_, which can be freely accessed through any Globus account.

You can also browse the dataset directly `here <https://users.flatironinstitute.org/~mgrudic/starforge_data>`_.


Binder
======

It is also possible to perform limited analysis and computation with the data on Rusty directly via `Binder <https://wiki.flatironinstitute.org/Public/UsingFiBinder>`_:
1. Give mike a gmail address you will use - if your institution uses gmail, your institution email will work. This must be added to the permissions list.
2. Go to binder.flatironinstitute.org and login with that gmail account.
3. Launch project with owner `starforge` and project name `starforge` and it will take you to the binder interface where you can do terminals and notebooks.
