Routines for statistical analysis of the stellar initial mass function.

## get_imf.py
Does a pass over the simulation snapshots to determine the maximum mass ever attained by each star, which we take to be its 'ZAMS' mass for IMF purposes.

## fit_mass_func.py
Routines for various standard forms of the IMF and computing MCMC chains to get posterior samples of IMF parameters

## simple_powerlaw_fit.py
A simple routine for Bayesian fitting of 1D data to a power-law distribution.
