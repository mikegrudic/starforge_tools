STARFORGE Wiki
==============

|anvil_of_creation.png|

Welcome to our project wiki! This is intended to serve as a repository
of useful knowledge for developing, running, and analyzing the
`STARFORGE <http://www.starforge.space>`__ simulations, and related
simulations using the
`GIZMO <http://http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~phopkins/Site/GIZMO.html>`__
code.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have spent time figuring out a technical task when working with
the simulations, chances are somebody else has too, and it’s a good idea
to write it down to help out the next person. This wiki is set up so
that approved users can create and edit pages. If you wish to
contribute, please register an account, and you’ll be able to edit the
wiki once approved by the admin.
